# sorting-visuliser
this is my first project and this was nothing less than adventure.
this website is designed to make sorting algorithms easy to learn for beginners.
bubble-sort, insertion-sort and selection-sort have been taken into consideration.
its taking a random array of size from 5 to 10 and filling them with random elements, then sort them according to choosen algorithm.
